# AI Chess Engine (Ongoing project)

A Python-based chess engine with a graphical user interface using Pygame.

## About

This project implements a chess engine from scratch, including all the rules of chess such as piece movements, castling, en passant, and pawn promotion. It features:

- A complete chess rule set implementation
- An AI opponent using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- A graphical user interface built with Pygame

The engine is designed to be modular, allowing for easy expansion and improvement of its components.

## Features

- Full chess game logic
- Legal move generation for all pieces
- Special move handling (castling, en passant, pawn promotion)
- Check and checkmate detection
- Simple AI using minimax algorithm
- Graphical representation of the chess board and pieces
